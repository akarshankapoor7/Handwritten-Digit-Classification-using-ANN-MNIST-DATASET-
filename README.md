Objective: The goal is to build an ANN model that accurately classifies handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark in machine learning and consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

Steps Involved
#Data Preparation:

#Loading the Dataset: The MNIST dataset is typically available in libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
#Preprocessing:
Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255.
Reshape the images if necessary (flattening from 28x28 to 784).
Split the dataset into training (60,000 images) and testing (10,000 images) sets.
Model Design:

Input Layer: Accepts 784 features (flattened image).
Hidden Layers: One or more hidden layers with activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).
Output Layer: 10 neurons corresponding to the digits 0-9, typically using a softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each class.
Compilation:

#Use a loss function appropriate for classification, such as categorical cross-entropy.
Use an optimizer like Adam or SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) to minimize the loss function.
Specify metrics to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy.
Training the Model:

#Fit the model on the training data using a specified number of epochs and batch size.
Monitor training and validation loss/accuracy to prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation:

#Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the results to analyze the model's performance and identify misclassifications.
Prediction:

#Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen handwritten digit images.
